# Frontend PDF Report Generation Program

This is the JavaScript code for the front-end of the PDF report generation system for eqihost.com. 
This runs in the browser, and handles all the user input, interaction with the webpage, and exports PDF's.
The project is writen in Typescript, and is transcompiled and bundled using Webpack.
